<h1>My HTML Notes</h1>
<h2>HTML:HyperText Markup Language</h2>
<p>HyperText: Text that contains links to other text that the user can easily access,
    It's a way of connecting different pieces of information together
</p>
<p>
    Markup Language: adding instructions or tags to plain text to tell the computer how to display the text
    Eg: In HTML we use tags like (&lt;p&gt;) to indicate paragraphs and (&lt;h1&gt;) to indicate headings. This tells the computer
    to display the specified test in a paragraph or as a heading
</p>

<p>
    HTML(HyperText Markup Language): is the standard way we make and design webpages. It's like the blueprint or
     skeleton of a webpage, giving it its basic structure and layout.
     Think of it as the foundation for displaying content on the web.
