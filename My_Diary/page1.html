<h1>HTML Notes</h1>
<h2>HTML:HyperText Markup Language</h2>
<p>HyperText: Text that contains links to other text that the user can easily access,
    It's a way of connecting different pieces of information together
</p>
<p>
    Markup Language: adding instructions or tags to plain text to tell the computer how to display the text
    Eg: In HTML we use tags like (&lt;p&gt;) to indicate paragraphs and (&lt;h1&gt;) to indicate headings. This tells the computer
    to display the specified test in a paragraph or as a heading
</p>

<p>
    HTML(HyperText Markup Language): is the standard way we make and design webpages. It's like the blueprint or
     skeleton of a webpage, giving it its basic structure and layout.
     Think of it as the foundation for displaying content on the web.

<h3 id="anatomy">Anatomy Of An HTML Document</h3>
<p>Anythin in HTML between <strong>&lt;!-- and --&gt;</strong> is a comment</p>
<img src="images/anatomy.png" alt="Diagram showing the parts of an HTML document">
<p>In case you were wondering how i added the image above, I used the &lt;img&gt; element like this:</p>
<p>&lt;img src="path/to/your/image" alt="Image Description"&gt;</p>

<h3>Metadata in HTML</h3>
<p>Metadata is data that describes data</p>
<p>HTML uses the &lt;meta&gt; elemnt to add metadata to our HTML</p>
<p>&lt;meta&gt; elements include the 'name' and 'content' attributes.</p>
<p><em>name:</em>what type of information is stored in the metadata</p>
<p><em>content:</em>The actual content in the metadata</p>
<p>They can be used to include the author of the page and to give a description of the page</p>
<h4>Other types of metadata</h4>
<p>To make my webpage look better when it is shared on platforms like Facebook or Twitter,
     I use metadata to add some basic information</p>
     <img src="" alt="">

<h3 id="favicon">A Favicon</h3>
<p>a small icon or group of icons associated with a website.Can Mostly be seen on browser tabs(on the left
    side of the website name), bookmarks(when you bookmark a page)
</p>

<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>Hyperlinks allow us link documents to other documents or resources, when a hyperlink is clicked it takes you to another
    webpage
</p>
<p>A link is created by wrapping text or content inside the anchor &lt;a&gt; element with a 'href' attribute containing the
    webpage you want to text to link to
</p>
<p>You can make almost anything a link,the heading of your website, an Image,
    you just have to wrap it in the anchor element</p>
<p>A title attribute can also be added to the anchor &lt;a&gt; elemnt. This title elemnt contains additional information
    about the link
</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><em>URL: Uniform Resource Locator</em> - is a string of text that defines where something
is located on the web</p>
<h3>Document Fragments</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks can also be used to direct users to a specific part of an HTML Document known as 'Document Fragments' rather
    than linking to the top of the webpage
</p>
<p>To do this you assign an 'id' attribute to the element you want to link to</p>
<p>You can link to a specifiic part of another webpage or the same webpage</p>
<p></p>This will take us to the <a href="#favicon">favicon</a> part of this webpage</p>
