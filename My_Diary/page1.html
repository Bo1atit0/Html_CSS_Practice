<h1>HTML Notes</h1>
<h2>HTML:HyperText Markup Language</h2>
<p>HyperText: Text that contains links to other text that the user can easily access,
    It's a way of connecting different pieces of information together
</p>
<p>
    Markup Language: adding instructions or tags to plain text to tell the computer how to display the text
    Eg: In HTML we use tags like (&lt;p&gt;) to indicate paragraphs and (&lt;h1&gt;) to indicate headings. This tells the computer
    to display the specified test in a paragraph or as a heading
</p>

<p>
    HTML(HyperText Markup Language): is the standard way we make and design webpages. It's like the blueprint or
     skeleton of a webpage, giving it its basic structure and layout.
     Think of it as the foundation for displaying content on the web.

<h3>Metadata in HTML</h3>
<p>Metadata is data that describes data</p>
<p>HTML uses the &lt;meta&gt; elemnt to add metadata to our HTML</p>
<p>&lt;meta&gt; elements include the 'name' and 'content' attributes.</p>
<p><em>name:</em>what type of information is stored in the metadata</p>
<p><em>content:</em>The actual content in the metadata</p>
<p>They can be used to include the author of the page and to give a description of the page</p>
<h4>Other types of metadata</h4>
<p>To make my webpage look better when it is shared on platforms like Facebook or Twitter,
     I use metadata to add some basic information</p>
